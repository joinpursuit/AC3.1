##What's a DOM?

DOM stands for 'Document Object Model.' The DOM basically defines the logical structure of web documents and gives us a way to access and manipulate documents.

Everything in the web page is represented as a 'node' in the DOM. We can access and directly manipulate these nodes in order to change what appears on our web page.

Manipulating the DOM is an example of the power of JavaScript. We can use pure JavaScript to completely change all the HTML and CSS element in a webpage.

##Demo
- `document.body`
- `parent` and `child` nodes
- `innerHTML`
- `document.getElementById`
- `firstChild` / `lastChild`
- `firstChild` / `lastChild`

##Manipulating the DOM
We can add, remove, and change DOM elements using certain methods. DOM manipulation is the basis of adding interactivity to websites.

##Demo: Manipulating elements
- `document.body.appendChild`
- `document.createElement`
