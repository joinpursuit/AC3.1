##Browser events
Browsers are ruled by events. Events are constantly happening in the browser. Sometimes they are triggered by users (think of clicks, drags, touches) or by the browser itself.

Watching for browser events gives us a lot of possibilities as developers - we can trigger certain reactions and changes when a user clicks on something, for example. 

##Demo: Browser events
- `onClick`
- `mouseover`
- event listeners
- event propogation

##Intro to callbacks
Callbacks are esssentially just functions that are passed in as arguments to another function, and executed at some later time. 

Callbacks are typically triggered after some other event happens. In other words, the original function hands over control to some external website or event, and once that event happens, the original function's callback function is executed.

##Demo: Brief intro to callbacks
- `setTimeout` callback
